# Factotum

[![Release][release-image]][releases] [![Apache License 2.0][license-image]][license]

A dag running tool designed for efficiently running complex jobs with non-trivial dependency trees. 

## The zen of Factotum

1. A Turing-complete job is not a job, it's a program
2. A job must be composable from other jobs
3. A job exists independently of any job schedule

## User quickstart

Assuming you're running **64 bit Linux**: 

```{bash}
wget https://github.com/snowplow/factotum/releases/download/0.6.0/factotum_0.6.0_linux_x86_64.zip
unzip factotum_0.6.0_linux_x86_64.zip
./factotum --version
```

Factotum requires one argument, which is a **[factotum factfile](/README.md#factfile-format)** that describes the job to run. For example, to run the sample **[sleep.factfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowplow/factotum/master/samples/sleep.factfile)**:

```{bash}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowplow/factotum/master/samples/sleep.factfile
./factotum run sleep.factfile
```
Specifying variables in the job file can be done using `--env JSON` (or `-e JSON`). The `JSON` here is free-form and needs to correspond to the placeholders you've set in your job.

For example, the following will print "hello world!":

```{bash}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowplow/factotum/master/samples/variables.factfile
./factotum run variables.factfile --env '{ "message": "hello world!" }'
```

Starting from an arbitrary task can be done using the `--start TASK` or `-s TASK` arguments, where TASK is the name of the task you'd like to start at.

For example, to start at the "echo beta" task in [this job](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowplow/factotum/master/samples/echo.factfile), you can run the following:

```{bash}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snowplow/factotum/master/samples/echo.factfile
./factotum run echo.factfile --start "echo beta"
```

To get a quick overview of the options provided, you can use the `--help` or `-h` argument:

```{bash}
./factotum --help
```
 
For more information on this file format and how to write your own jobs, see the **[Factfile format](/README.md#factfile-format)** section below.

## Factfile format

Factfiles are self-describing JSON which declare a series of tasks and their dependencies. For example: 

```{json}
{
    "schema": "iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.factotum/factfile/jsonschema/1-0-0",
    "data": {
        "name": "Factotum demo",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "name": "echo alpha",
                "executor": "shell",
                "command": "echo",
                "arguments": [ "alpha" ],
                "dependsOn": [],
                "onResult": {
                    "terminateJobWithSuccess": [],
                    "continueJob": [ 0 ]
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "echo beta",
                "executor": "shell",
                "command": "echo",
                "arguments": [ "beta" ],
                "dependsOn": [ "echo alpha" ],
                "onResult": {
                    "terminateJobWithSuccess": [],
                    "continueJob": [ 0 ]
                }
            },
            {
                "name": "echo omega",
                "executor": "shell",
                "command": "echo",
                "arguments": [ "and omega!" ],
                "dependsOn": [ "echo beta" ],
                "onResult": {
                    "terminateJobWithSuccess": [],
                    "continueJob": [ 0 ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

This example defines three tasks that run shell commands - `echo alpha`, `echo beta` and `echo omega`. `echo alpha` has no dependencies - it will run immediately. `echo beta` depends
on the completion of the `echo alpha` task, and so will wait for `echo alpha` to complete. `echo omega` depends on the `echo beta` task, and so will wait for `echo beta` to be complete before 
executing. 

Given the above, the tasks will be executed in the following sequence: `echo alpha`, `echo beta` and finally, `echo omega`. Tasks can have multiple dependencies in factotum, and tasks that are parallelizable will
be run concurrently. Check out **[the samples](/samples)** for more sample factfiles or **[the wiki](https://github.com/snowplow/factotum/wiki#creating-a-job)** for a more complete description of the factfile format. 

## Developer quickstart

Factotum is written in **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)**.

### Using Vagrant

* Clone this repository - `git clone git@github.com:snowplow/factotum.git`
* `cd factotum`
* Set up a Vagrant box and ssh into it - `vagrant up && vagrant ssh`
   * This will take a few minutes
* `cd /vagrant`
